# Kerr-orbits

Bounded photon orbits around a spinning Black Hole with no charge. Natural units are used G=M=C=1; spin of the black hole is then 0<=a<=1. Bound orbits turn out to have a fixed radius r. Note: not all the values for the pairs of the parameters (r,a) are solutions.

The visualization is done in Kerr-Schild (carteesian) coordinates.
